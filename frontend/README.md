# TODO

1. Allow password modification
2. Standard CRUD page
  - Create
  - Read
    - list (DONE)
    - retrieve (Done)
  - Update
  - Delete (DONE)
  - Reactivity, toasts, field errors, etc.
- Generalise CRUD page
1. Delete self
2. Differences for admins?
  - View all data?
  - User management? Yes probably required.

## Maybe
6. I would have liked to use the StatefulButton on modal but maybe not very easy
