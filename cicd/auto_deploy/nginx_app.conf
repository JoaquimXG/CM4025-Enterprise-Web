# Nginx configuration file for nginx proxy on primary instance
# This will proxy requests for /api to the backend container
# and requests for / to the frontend container
# For the example deployment this will listen on 443
# but it is disabled here as you won't have SSL certificate
# This file should be copied to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
# There is no need to copy to /etc/nginx/sites-available/ and link as there will only ever be one config


# This configuration block is not included for the submission deployment as HTTPS connections won't work unless you play with your local hosts file.
# This is included for reference only, it will redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
